This is an n8n community node that provides simplified Bitbucket operations with smart defaults and common workflows.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Features

Quick Bitbucket makes it easy to:
- **Commit Files**: Create or update files and commit them to a repository
- **Create Pull Requests**: Open new pull requests with ease
- **Manage PRs**: Add comments, get details, merge, and search pull requests
- **Branch Operations**: Create branches and get file content
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible defaults reduce configuration time

## Installation

Or install directly via npm:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-quick-bitbucket

  - Path: README.md
    Content: # Updated Documentation\n\nThis was updated automatically.
Commit Message: Update README via n8n workflow
```

### 2. Create Pull Request
Open a new pull request from one branch to another.

**Use case**: Automate PR creation after feature branches are ready.

Destination Branch: main
Title: Add new authentication feature

```

### 3. Add PR Comment

```
Repository: my-project
Branch: main

```

### 8. Create Branch
